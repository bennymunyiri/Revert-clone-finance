_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._

Note from Revert:

Liquidations of undercollateralized positions may be temporarily disabled when the pool price of a position is moved away too much from the oracle price. This issue is automatically resolved by arbitrage in most cases, but if there is not enough incentive to do so, the liquidator has enough incentive to do the arbitrage as part of the liquidation process - because of the liquidation premium. For more details see Finding 4 in the audit by Hydn (see below).

# Overview

This repository contains the smart contracts for Revert Lend protocol.

It uses Foundry as development toolchain.

To get an understanding of the basic concepts, and advanced topics like transformers please read the whitepaper.

## Out of scope

Everything NOT in /src and NOT in [scope.txt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-revert-lend/blob/main/scope.txt)

# Additional Context

- Roles in the protocol: Owner (which will be set to a Multisig and Timelock), EmergencyAdmin (which will be set to a Multisig), Operators (which are EOA used by bots to call actions in Automator contracts)

- Special ERC20 tokens like fee-on-transfer or rebasing tokens are not supported. Usage of them will revert.

- The only allowed ERC721 are UniswapV3 positions.

- The protocol should be able to be deployed on any EVM compatible chain - by using chain specific config values

- `V3Vault`: Should comply with `ERC/EIP4626`


## Attack ideas (Where to look for bugs)
- Reentrancy
- Share calculation
- Price manipulation
- Crafted ERC-20 Tokens
- Crafted external swap calldata

## Main invariants
- Debt can never be bigger than lent assets (after all loans are payed back or liquidated).

## Scoping Details 
```

- Check all that apply (e.g. timelock, NFT, AMM, ERC20, rollups, etc.): NFT, AMM, ERC-20 Token  
- Is there a need to understand a separate part of the codebase / get context in order to audit this part of the protocol?: UniswapV3, Permit2  
- Does it use an oracle?: Chainlink, Uniswap V3 TWAP
- Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models your code uses: No 
- Is this either a fork of or an alternate implementation of another project?: False

```

# Tests

First time run 

```sh
forge install
```

to get dependencies. Then:

Because the v3-periphery library (Solidity v0.8 branch) in `lib/v3-periphery/contracts/libraries/PoolAddress.sol` has a different `POOL_INIT_CODE_HASH` than the one deployed on Mainnet this needs to be changed for the integration tests to work properly and for deployment!

```solidity
bytes32 internal constant POOL_INIT_CODE_HASH = 0xa598dd2fba360510c5a8f02f44423a4468e902df5857dbce3ca162a43a3a31ff;
```

needs to be changed to 

```solidity
bytes32 internal constant POOL_INIT_CODE_HASH = 0xe34f199b19b2b4f47f68442619d555527d244f78a3297ea89325f843f87b8b54;
```

Most tests use a forked state of Ethereum Mainnet. You can run all tests with: 

```sh
forge test
```

If the `https://rpc.ankr.com/eth` fork url isn't working, please replace it with your own rpc url (from the likes of Alchemy or Infura).

## Slither

See [slither.txt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-revert-lend/blob/main/slither.txt) or run with `slither .`
